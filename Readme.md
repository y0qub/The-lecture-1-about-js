# JavaScript Variables and Constants
## 1.-VAR          
## 2.-LET
## 3.-CONST
--------------------
In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, **VAR** and **LET**. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them.
________________________________________
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't 
change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use **CONST**.
